        <section class="slide">
            <h3>Till Death Do Us Part</h3>
            <a href="https://tddup.netlify.app/"><img src="./imgs/tddup.png"></a>
            <p>The project above is a text adventure where you play as a survivor in a zombie apocalypse. I did all of
                the JavaScript while Jack Franks did most of the story. If you would like to play it then click the
                image
                above.
            </p>

        <section class="slide">
            <h3>Jurrassic Outfitting Company</h3>
            <a href="https://jurassicoutfitting.netlify.app/jurassic-outfitting-co/home"><img src="./imgs/joc.png"></a>
            <p class="typeani">This project is a website Taha and I made for customers that attend Jurrassic Park.
                Obviously we are not
                crazy, we knew it was fictional. Taha did the styling and JavaScript while I designed the
                website.
            </p>

        <section class="slide">
            <h3>Budget Calculator</h3>
            <a href="https://budgetcalculators.netlify.app/"><img src="./imgs/budget.png"></a>
            <p class="typeani">This is a project that I worked on by myself, obviously it's not finished but it somewhat
                works well. Its purpose is to display the amount of money you have left over after calculating all of
                your expenses.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h3>Michael Certificates</h3>
            <a href="https://certificatemakers.netlify.app/"><img src="./imgs/certificate.png"></a>
            <p class="typeani">This is a certificate maker that I made. It can make funny certificates for you. You
                input your name and the type of certificate you want at the top left.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h3>Zen Garden</h3>
            <a href="https://michaelzengarden.netlify.app/"><img src="./imgs/zen.png"></a>
            <p class="typeani">This is one of my early projects in Web Development, we were provided an HTML file and
                were tasked to style it without modifying the contents of the HTML file (the HTML file includes text and
                images). So although each student had the same text content, each website varied widely depending on
                what we had in mind for the design.</p>
