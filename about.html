    <h2>My name is Michael</h2>
    <p>I attend both CART and Clovis West, I take Web Applications here at CART and take Computer Science A at Clovis
        West. The purpose of this website was to showcase my skills of both web development and design.</p>
    <!-- I don't wanna add a gif here yet since the styling/animations aren't really done yet -->
    <img src="" alt="I will add this later, gif of CSS and JS in action like the hello thing on the front page.">

    <p>In order to showcase my skills to there fullest potential I paired my JS skills with my CSS skills to make cool
        things happen on my website, like for example the "Hello" animation I made that cycles through many different
        languages.</p>

    <img src="./imgs/projects.png" alt="img of my projects" style="width: 30%;">

    <p>All of the skills showcased on the website are skills that I've built up over many years of playing around with
        programming. I love programming and my favorite thing about programming is problem solving. I have been
        programming since I was in 7th grade and I've been in love ever since.</p>

    <p>I want to thank Mr. Fast for providing the environment possible to extend what I thought was possible with my
        programming.</p>
