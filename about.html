                <h1>Hi.</h1>
                <p>My name is Michael. I attend both CART and Clovis West, I take Web Applications here at CART and take
                    Computer Science A at
                    Clovis
                    West. The purpose of this website was to showcase my skills of both web development and design.
                    Pairing both of these skills together brings you this (hopefully) awesome website.</p>

            <p>In order to showcase my skills to there fullest potential I paired my JS skills with my CSS skills to
                make
                cool things happen on my website, like for example the "Hello" animation I made that cycles through many
                different languages.</p>

            <p>All of the skills showcased on the website are skills that I've built up over many years of playing
                around
                with
                programming. I love programming and my favorite thing about programming is problem solving. I have been
                programming since I was in 7th grade and I've been in love ever since.</p>

            <p>I want to thank Mr. Fast for providing the environment possible to extend what I thought was possible
                with my
                programming.</p>
